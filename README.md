API Testing with Postman Collections
This project includes API testing using Postman. To execute the tests, you must have Postman installed on your laptop.

In this repository, you will find automated test scripts designed to verify various aspects of the Reqres.in website. The test cases have been organized into a Postman collection.

Included in this repository are:

Reqres.in_collection.json _ a Postman collection containing all the relevant test cases.

test.postman_environment.json. _ an environment file for Postman.

Feel free to explore the collection and environment files to run the tests and review the test cases.
